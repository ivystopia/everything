# We are not vegans - they are carnists

What we currently call "veganism" is actually humanity's moral baseline.

## Definitions

### Carnism

- The prevailing belief system that conditions us to exploit certain animals while loving others.

### Veganism

- The moral stance that rejects carnism.
- It transcends dietary choices and redefines our entire relationship with non-human animals.
- It recognizes the inherent worth of all non-human animals, advocating for their right to live free from human-imposed harm.

_According to The Vegan Society:_

> "Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practicable — all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans, and the environment. In dietary terms, it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."

## Why Should I Care?

- We have been raised from birth in a system where the exploitation of non-human animals is normalised and obscured.
- Yet these cultural norms cause immense suffering, all for fleeting pleasures like taste or convenience.
- The demand from individual consumers, like you and me, drives the cycle of breeding, exploiting, and slaughtering animals.

## The Ethical Imperative

- Non-human animals, like humans, are individuals who experience pain, fear, and joy.
- Carnism conditions us to disregard their suffering and view them as commodities.
- Humans, as ethical agents, have the ability to make choices based on morality rather than instinct.
- The systemic harm caused by animal farming is staggering:
  - Billions of animals are bred, confined, and killed annually.
  - Each one is an individual who wanted to live, just as we do.
- Veganism is the ethical **choice to stop participating** in this needless suffering.
- Although carnism remains legal, history reminds us that legality often lags behind moral progress.

## The Bigger Picture

- Choosing veganism also contributes to a healthier planet:
  - Animal agriculture is a leading cause of deforestation, water scarcity, and climate change.
  - A plant-based diet reduces greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water consumption.
- It also benefits human health:
  - Whole-food plant-based diets can lower risks of heart disease, certain cancers, and other chronic conditions.
- However, these are secondary to the core issue:
  - Ending the systematic oppression of non-human animals is a moral imperative, not merely a dietary preference.

## Rethinking Humanity's Role

- I hope for a world where the term "animal farming" becomes as abhorrent as other historical injustices we now reject.
- Humanity has a unique capacity for empathy and ethical reasoning. By rejecting carnism, we take the next step on our long-term ethical journey as a species.
- A compassionate world begins with **individual actions**:
  - Reflect on the beliefs you've been taught.
  - Recognize the inherent worth of all life.
  - Take steps to live in alignment with your values.

## Join the Movement

- **Renounce carnism.**
- Every purchase is a choice, and every choice can minimise our contribution to the death machine.
- Systemic change starts with individual actions that collectively reshape our culture.
- Everyone who leaves carnism helps to normalise veganism.
